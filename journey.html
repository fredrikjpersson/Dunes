         Dunes of Demise started out as a 9 week project during 2018.
          The game could be described as a post apocalyptic travel adventrue with resource management and turned based combat.
          The player would start with a single car and two characters, the game would later have the player recruit more cars and characters while forming a caravan.
          ￼
          The original team [Team HAMM] consisted of:
          Henrik Lindfors
          Arvid Stenersjö
          Mattias Celius
          ￼Marcus Josefsson
        
          
          The original game was made in a low poly art style and active turn based combat.
          The combat would recieve some critisism from the juror at the end of the project assesment period.
          A year later (February 2019), Henrik and Arvid decided to take the concept and pitch it in front of a jury in Skellefteå.
          The pitch made it to the next round and a new team was formed around the project:
          ￼
          Henrik Lindfors
          Arvid Stenersjö
          Mattias Celius
          Tobias Lundin
          Oscar Svahn
          Niklas Marklund
          
          
          The team had taking the critisism to heart by now and decided to revamp portions of the game, such as the combat system.
          Instead of the typical JRPG Active Turn Based system previously used in the prototype the team used a grid based turnbased combat system where the player could shoot using any character in the vehicle and ram cars into incoming debris on the road.
          ￼
          During Nordsken 2019 the game won a spot at GamesCom 2019.
          The team is currently looking for ways to fund the continued development of the title.
